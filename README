=== ABOUT ===

Project repository https://github.com/masterdezign/open-index

Open index is intended to be used in small and middle-sized projects that
need a search capability.
Currently index supports Unicode and works only with collections of .txt documents.

Architecture remarks:
While handlers implement primary storage and lookup routines,
indexers provide generic indexing and search algorithms.

               simple_handler    --<>               <-- simple_indexer
RAM          / positional_handler--<>               <-- positional_indexer    indexing engine
       <=> x    ...                   indexer_base        ...             <=>
storage      \ bsbi_handler      --<>               <-- bsbi_indexer          search server
                ...

Wrappers are intended for wide indexers reuse with new features (provided
by wrappers).

=== REQUIREMENTS ===

ruby1.8-dev
rubygems
gem json

=== INSTALLATION ===

Edit config/index.rb. There you can set INDEX_DIR where index files will
be stored.

=== TESTS ===

Please find tests in test/ directory in order to get to know code faster
and in greater detail. Also you can find test/sample_texts/ which were used
below.

To run all tests simply type

$ rake test
